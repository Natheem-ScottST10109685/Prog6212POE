Firstly,
Please Add your own file path in the Home Controller to have the system run the code properly or else it will not work.

I used a local file path because my azure was not working as well as it was in Cloud Development. As I am already facing problems with it currently. 

Secondly,
When you run the code Select Lecturer then submit a new claim and then fill in the details and click submit. THis will turn the details into a text file and save it in the file path you replaced with mine. 

Thirdly,
Once you submit the claim select the option to return the Home page or click Home in the NavBar and then select Coordinator or Manager does not matter which one of the two you select you will be directed to the same page. In that page you will be able to Approve or Reject the Claim, which will update the file and say Aprroved or Rejected.

The local file Path will allow you to store the text files of the Lecturer claims and then the claims will be called to the CoordMange.cshtml and will be display in a table form.
